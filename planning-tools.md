# Planning & Tools

This section documents the planning process, automation scripts, and tools I've built to support my learning journey. This is where the systematic approach comes together—how I plan my study schedules, track progress, and automate repetitive tasks.

## Planning Sessions

Documentation of planning sessions with Claude Code, showing how weekly schedules are created, problems are solved, and systems are improved.

## Automation Scripts

### Schedule Generation System
- **Weekly Schedule Generator**: Python script that creates study schedules from JSON configurations
- **Google Calendar Integration**: Automatic ICS file generation and upload
- **Module Extraction**: Pulls actual course content from master catalogue

### Study Tracking
- **Enhanced Study Tracker**: Calendar-based HTML tracker with session logging
- **Progress Analytics**: Automated tracking of study hours, completion rates, and goals
- **Blog Integration**: Automatic commit of study sessions to blog

## System Architecture

Documentation of how all the pieces fit together:
- JSON configuration files → Weekly schedule generation → ICS calendar events
- Study sessions → Tracker → Blog posts → Public documentation
- Course catalogue → Module extraction → Accurate content planning
