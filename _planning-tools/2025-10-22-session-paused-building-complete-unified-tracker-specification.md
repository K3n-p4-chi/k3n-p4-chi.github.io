# Session Paused - Building Complete Unified Tracker Specification

## Summary
Session Paused - Building Complete Unified Tracker Specification

## What Was Achieved
- Created complete specification for unified Enhanced Tracker
- Defined architecture: Calendar (60%) + Sidebar (40%) layout
- Documented complete data flow: View → Study → Log → Sync → Blog
- Listed all required features (16 feature categories)
- Designed session data structure (pre-filled + user-entered)
- Created blog post template for study sessions
- Planned 5-phase implementation approach
- Estimated ~2000 lines of code for complete version

## Problems Solved
Unified Tracker Scope Definition
- Enhanced Tracker needs to do EVERYTHING (not just viewing)
- Must have sync folder like Study_Tracker_plus
- Must pre-fill metadata from week configs
- Must have full logging form with editable fields
- Must integrate with blog_logger.py
- Must auto-commit to GitHub

Solution: Complete specification document
- BUILDING_UNIFIED_TRACKER.md created
- Clear architecture and layout design
- Complete feature list
- Data structures defined
- Implementation phases planned

## Tools & Scripts Created
Specification Document: BUILDING_UNIFIED_TRACKER.md
- Architecture diagram (calendar + sidebar)
- Complete data flow charts
- Feature checklist (16 categories)
- Technical implementation details
- Session data structure (JSON schemas)
- Blog post template
- 5-phase implementation plan

## Next Steps
Ready to build complete unified tracker!
Estimated scope: ~2000 lines of HTML/CSS/JS

Next session will implement:
1. Complete Enhanced_Tracker_Complete.html
2. Calendar view + Sidebar panel
3. Sync folder integration
4. Session logging form
5. Blog auto-commit integration
6. Full testing workflow
