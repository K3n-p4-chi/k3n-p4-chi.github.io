# Session 1: Fabricated Content Discovery and System Audit

## Summary
Session 1: Fabricated Content Discovery and System Audit

## What Was Achieved
- Discovered all course module names were fabricated, not from catalogue
- Created extract_course_modules.py to verify actual module names
- Created CONTENT_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md documenting all discrepancies
- Identified critical issue: "ISO 27001 deep dive" had wrong modules
- Verified actual modules from phase1_master_catalogue.json

## Problems Solved
CRITICAL: Content Fabrication Issue
- All module names were hardcoded guesses, not extracted from catalogue
- Example: Claimed "Risk management introduction (60 min)" 
  Actual: "Introduction to information risk management [ISME] (65 min)"
- FLEX events pointing to wrong courses
- Module durations not matching actual content

Root Cause: No catalogue integration in generator

## Tools & Scripts Created
- extract_course_modules.py: Extracts actual module names from catalogue
- CONTENT_AUDIT_FINDINGS.md: Documentation of all discrepancies
- phase1_master_catalogue.json: Source of truth for all course content

## Next Steps
1. Rebuild schedule generator with catalogue integration
2. Create functions to auto-extract modules based on duration
3. Test with Week 5 schedule
4. Verify all module names match catalogue exactly
