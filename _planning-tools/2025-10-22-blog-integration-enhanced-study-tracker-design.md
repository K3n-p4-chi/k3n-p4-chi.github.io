# Blog Integration & Enhanced Study Tracker Design

## Summary
Blog Integration & Enhanced Study Tracker Design

## What Was Achieved
- Set up blog repository structure with new sections
- Created Planning & Tools section for automation/scripts documentation
- Created Study Notes & Learning section for session logs
- Built blog_logger.py for automatic session commits
- Designed calendar-based tracker with pre-loaded metadata
- Integrated tracker → blog auto-publish workflow

## Problems Solved
Solved blog organization:
- Blog now has dedicated sections for planning vs studying vs work projects
- Planning sessions (Claude Code work) go to _planning-tools
- Study sessions (actual learning) go to _study-notes
- Work projects go to _real-life-application

## Tools & Scripts Created
- blog_logger.py: Python script for automatic blog commits
- Enhanced tracker design with calendar view
- JSON-based weekly schedule integration

## Next Steps
1. Build enhanced study tracker with calendar interface
2. Integrate tracker with blog auto-commit on save
3. Update weekly schedule generator to output to tracker location
4. Test complete flow: Schedule → Tracker → Blog
