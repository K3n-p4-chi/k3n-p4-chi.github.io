# QA Content Downloader V4 - Complete Article Extraction

## Summary
QA Content Downloader V4 - Complete Article Extraction

## What Was Achieved

- Upgraded video downloader from V3 to V4 with full article support
- Created content type detection system (video vs article identification)
- Implemented PDF extraction for article-based lectures using Chrome DevTools Protocol
- Added content type tagging system: [V] for videos, [A] for articles
- Updated extraction flow to handle mixed content in single workflow
- Created comprehensive V4 documentation (README_VIDEO_DOWNLOADER_V4.md)
- Created detailed testing guide (V4_TESTING_GUIDE.md)
- Maintained all V3 features: 1080p quality, module organization, resume capability
- Created qa_video_downloader_v4_with_articles.py (~1000 lines)


## Problems Solved

- V3 limitation: Only extracted videos, skipped all article-based lectures
- Incomplete course downloads missing important text-based content
- No way to identify content types without opening files
- Manual effort required to access skipped article lectures
- Path length issues with long titles (solved with numbered files + .txt metadata)
- PDF generation from web pages (used Selenium's native print_to_PDF)
- Content type detection from lecture pages (multi-method detection)
- Mixed content numbering (unified sequential numbering)


## Tools & Scripts Created

- qa_video_downloader_v4_with_articles.py (new)
- README_VIDEO_DOWNLOADER_V4.md (comprehensive documentation)
- V4_TESTING_GUIDE.md (testing protocol)
- Selenium Chrome DevTools Protocol for PDF generation
- BeautifulSoup for page parsing
- yt-dlp for video downloads (inherited from V3)
- Content type detection algorithms
- [V]/[A] tagging system


## Next Steps

- User to test V4 on single course with mixed content
- Validate: videos (MP4), articles (PDF), tags ([V]/[A])
- Verify: 1080p quality, readable PDFs, correct numbering
- After successful test: run on full subdomain
- Document test results in V4_TEST_RESULTS.md
- Replace V3 with V4 for all future extractions
- Monitor first production run for edge cases
