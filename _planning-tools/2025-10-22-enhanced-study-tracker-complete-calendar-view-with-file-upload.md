# Enhanced Study Tracker Complete - Calendar View with File Upload

## Summary
Enhanced Study Tracker Complete - Calendar View with File Upload

## What Was Achieved
- Fixed Enhanced Tracker data loading (works offline now!)
- Used localStorage + FileReader (same as Study_Tracker_plus.html)
- Created Enhanced_Tracker.html with proper file upload functionality
- Calendar displays all loaded week schedules
- Pre-loads metadata from JSON config files
- One-click access to course URLs
- Visual calendar with CORE/FLEX color coding
- Works completely offline - no web server needed
- Created ENHANCED_TRACKER_QUICK_START.md user guide
- Tested with Week 5 config - working perfectly

## Problems Solved
Data Loading Issue
- Original Enhanced Tracker used fetch() which needs web server
- Doesnt work with file:// protocol
- Solution: Use FileReader + localStorage (like Study_Tracker_plus)
- User selects JSON files via file picker
- Data stored in browser localStorage
- Persists across sessions

Reference Implementation
- Studied Study_Tracker_plus.html to understand working approach
- It uses file pickers and localStorage successfully
- Applied same pattern to Enhanced Tracker
- Now both trackers work the same way (offline-first)

Result: Works perfectly offline, no server needed

## Tools & Scripts Created
Enhanced_Tracker.html Features:
- File picker for loading week<N>_config.json files
- localStorage for data persistence (key: enhanced_tracker_schedules)
- Calendar grid showing all scheduled sessions
- Modal view for session details
- Color-coded events (CORE=blue, FLEX=purple)
- Quick access buttons (Go to Course, Log Session)
- Clear All function to reset

User Guide:
- ENHANCED_TRACKER_QUICK_START.md
- Step-by-step instructions
- Troubleshooting section
- Comparison with Study_Tracker_plus
- Best practices for using both trackers

## Next Steps
Enhanced Tracker V1 complete and working!
Next phase (Session logging):
1. Build session logging form modal
2. Add fields: actual times, completion %, notes, reflections
3. Save to sessions.json
4. Integrate with blog_logger.py
5. Auto-publish to blog on save
6. Test complete workflow: Schedule → Study → Log → Blog
