# Session 3: ICS Metadata Cleanup and Folder Organization Design

## Summary
Session 3: ICS Metadata Cleanup and Folder Organization Design

## What Was Achieved
- Fixed ICS metadata fields appearing in calendar description
- Removed LOCATION, STATUS, CLASS, TRANSP from generate_ics() (lines 563-575)
- Regenerated Week 5 schedule with clean ICS format
- Uploaded clean version to Google Calendar - verified metadata no longer shows
- Designed folder reorganization strategy:
  * Create generic weekly generator (ONE script for all weeks)
  * Organize outputs: Markdown/, Schedule_Files/, Tracker/
  * Move calendar scripts to folder 05
  * Review and archive obsolete files

## Problems Solved
ICS Metadata Visibility Issue
- LOCATION, STATUS, CLASS, TRANSP were showing in calendar description
- User feedback: "Event characteristic are back in view again"
- Solution: Remove these fields entirely from ICS generation
- Only keep: DTSTART, DTEND, SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION, URL
- Result: Clean calendar view with just description and URL

Folder Organization Problem
- 70+ files in 03 Schedule folder (too messy)
- Week-specific generator means 15 separate scripts needed
- Output files scattered in root directory
- Solution: Generic generator + subfolder organization

## Tools & Scripts Created
Modified generate_week5_schedule.py:
- Lines 563-575: Removed metadata fields
- Kept only essential ICS fields:
  * DTSTART, DTEND, DTSTAMP, UID
  * SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION, URL
  * NO: LOCATION, STATUS, CLASS, TRANSP

## Next Steps
1. Create generate_weekly_schedule.py (generic, not week-specific)
2. Create subfolders: Markdown/, Schedule_Files/, Tracker/
3. Move calendar automation to folder 05
4. Archive 40+ obsolete files
