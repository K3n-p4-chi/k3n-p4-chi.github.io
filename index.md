# Cloud Security Engineering Journey

Welcome to my professional blog documenting the systematic transition from **Network Engineering** to **Cloud Cyber Security Engineering**.
## 🗂️ What You'll Find Here
- **Real certification study data** with actual scores and timelines
- **Technical automation projects** with code and documentation
- **Career transition insights** from applications to interviews
- **Home lab configurations** and cloud experiments

## 📈 Career Roadmap & Progression Goals

### 🏗️ **Phase 1: Foundation Building (August 2025 - March 2026)**
**Duration:** 7 months | **Study Commitment:** 24+ hours/week intensive focus

**Strategic Reality Check:** CCNA assessment week (August 5-9, 2025) revealed **34.7% average** across all domains, requiring complete knowledge rebuild rather than simple renewal.

**Revised Certification Timeline:**
- **Microsoft AZ-900** (Azure Fundamentals) - August 2025 ✅
  
🎯 Current Focus: CCNA Intensive Study** (August 2025 - February 2026) - Complete foundation rebuild
- **PowerShell/Bash Mastery** (February 2026) - Automation scripting foundation
- **SC-900** (March 2026) - Security & Compliance fundamentals
- **CompTIA Security+** (April 2026) - Industry-standard security certification

**Strategic Adaptation:** Python completely paused until CCNA foundations secured. 100% focus on closing critical knowledge gaps identified through systematic assessment.

**Expected Salary Range:** £50,000-£70,000  
**Target Roles:** Junior Cloud Security Engineer, Network Automation Specialist

### 🔐 **Phase 2: Cloud Network & Security Specialisation (May 2026 - November 2026)**
**Duration:** 7 months | **Study Commitment:** 20+ hours/week

**Multi-Technology Integration Strategy:**
- **Python PCEP** (May 2026) - Resume Python with network automation focus
- **Cisco Meraki Specialist** (June 2026) - Leverage KCP Network experience
- **Microsoft AZ-500** (August 2026) - Azure Security Engineer Associate
- **Microsoft AZ-104** (October 2026) - Azure Administrator Associate
- **Microsoft SC-300** (November 2026) - Identity & Access Administrator

**Automation Trinity:** CCNA + Python + PowerShell creating unique market positioning for infrastructure automation roles.

**Expected Salary Range:** £70,000-£100,000  
**Target Roles:** Cloud Security Engineer, Infrastructure Automation Specialist, Senior Network Engineer

**Target Career Opportunity: Infrastructure Engineer**

**Market Research Validation:** Hedge fund Infrastructure Engineer roles (£80-85K + 25% bonus = £100-106K total) perfectly align with Phase 2 skill development, representing significant salary acceleration opportunity.

**Application Timeline:** June-August 2026 (post-CCNA completion with automation portfolio)

### 💰 **Phase 3: Advanced Architecture & Leadership (December 2026 - May 2027)**
**Duration:** 6/7 months | **Study Commitment:** 15+ hours/week

**Expert-Level Positioning:**
- **Microsoft AZ-305** (February 2027) - Azure Solutions Architect Expert
- **Advanced Specialisations** (May 2027) - CISSP preparation or additional expert certifications
- **Enterprise Portfolio** - Public GitHub repository with production-grade automation projects

**Expected Salary Range:** £100,000-£130,000+  
**Target Roles:** Principal Cloud Engineer, Cloud Security Architect, Infrastructure Engineering Manager


### 🛠️ **Risk Management & Adaptation Strategy**
**"Python as Constant Companion" Paused:** Assessment data revealed critical need for singular CCNA focus. Python will resume May 2026 integrated with network automation applications.

**Assessment-Driven Planning:** Weekly progress validation using MeasureUp practice tests with systematic domain rebuilding approach.

**Career Acceleration Potential:** Structured approach positions for premium financial services roles exceeding original salary projections by £20-50K annually.

### 🛠️ **Automation & Portfolio Development**
**Ongoing throughout all phases:**
- PowerShell and Python automation projects
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/ARM templates)
- Security monitoring and incident response tools
- Hybrid cloud networking solutions
- Open-source contributions and technical writing
