# Introducing: AI-Powered Home Lab Orchestrator

> **Note**: This is the introduction to my ongoing home lab automation project.
> Jump to [Milestone 1: Dual Monitoring Platform]({% post_url 2025-10-27-homelab-milestone-1-dual-monitoring-platform-deployed %})
> to see the first major achievement.

## The Vision

What if you could manage your entire home lab infrastructure using natural language?
Instead of SSH-ing into multiple systems, writing complex scripts, and manually
configuring services, you could simply say:

> "Deploy a new monitoring system for my network"

or

> "Migrate all management services to VLAN 100"

or

> "Check if any devices are down and fix them"

And it would... just happen. Safely. Reliably. With full rollback capability.

**That's the goal of this project.**

## Why Build This?

### The Problem
Modern home labs are powerful but complex:
- Multiple virtualization platforms (Proxmox, Docker, LXC)
- Dozens of network devices (switches, routers, APs, NAS)
- Various monitoring systems (LibreNMS, PRTG, Prometheus)
- Manual configuration = time-consuming and error-prone
- Documentation gets outdated quickly
- Knowledge silos (you forget how you configured something 6 months ago)

### The Solution
An AI-powered orchestration layer that:
- **Understands** your infrastructure via monitoring APIs
- **Translates** natural language to infrastructure commands
- **Executes** changes safely with dry-run capability
- **Documents** everything automatically
- **Learns** from your environment over time

## The Technology Stack

### AI Layer (Dual-Claude Architecture)
- **Claude Desktop**: Strategic planning, architecture decisions
- **Claude Code**: Implementation, scripting, deployment
- Specialized models for different tasks
- Human-in-the-loop for critical operations

### Monitoring Layer (Dual Platform for Redundancy)
- **LibreNMS**: Open-source, SNMP-focused, API-first
- **PRTG Network Monitor**: Commercial, multi-protocol, comprehensive
- Both platforms cross-validate each other
- **Philosophy**: "Two is one, one is none" (no single point of failure)

### Infrastructure
- **Proxmox VE**: Virtualization platform
- **OPNsense**: Firewall and router
- **HP 48-Port Switch**: Managed switching with VLANs
- **Multiple NAS devices**: Storage (Synology, Western Digital)
- **Ruckus Wireless**: Access points
- **Smart home devices**: IoT integration

### Orchestration Bridge (Coming Soon)
- Python 3.11+ with FastAPI
- Async API calls to both monitoring platforms
- Redis for caching
- PostgreSQL for state management
- Natural language processing for commands

## Project Phases

### ‚úÖ Phase 0: Planning & Architecture
- Network topology design
- Technology stack decisions
- Dual-Claude workflow established
- Documentation structure created

### ‚úÖ Phase 1-3: Monitoring Infrastructure (COMPLETE)
- **[Milestone 1]({% post_url 2025-10-27-homelab-milestone-1-dual-monitoring-platform-deployed %}): Dual Monitoring Platform Deployed**
  - LibreNMS: 11 core devices
  - PRTG: 68 devices across all VLANs
  - Both APIs operational
  - Automatic polling and discovery

### ‚è≥ Phase 4: Monitoring Bridge (In Progress)
- Unified API aggregating both platforms
- Failover logic implementation
- Cross-validation of monitoring data
- REST API for AI orchestrator

### üìÖ Phase 5: VLAN 100 Migration (Planned)
- Separate management network
- Migrate monitoring infrastructure
- Test live with dual monitoring

### üìÖ Phase 6: AI Orchestrator LXCs (Planned)
- Deploy orchestrator containers
- API integration with monitoring bridge
- Natural language command processing
- Dry-run and rollback mechanisms

### üìÖ Phase 7: Natural Language Control (Future)
- Full voice/text commands
- Automated remediation
- Self-healing infrastructure
- Predictive maintenance

## Design Principles

### 1. Dual Everything
- **Dual monitoring** (LibreNMS + PRTG)
- **Dual Claude agents** (Desktop + Code)
- **Dual validation** (cross-check all operations)
- Principle: "Two is one, one is none"

### 2. API-First Architecture
- All systems must have APIs
- No screen scraping or SSH parsing
- Programmatic control of everything
- Infrastructure as code

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop
- AI proposes, human approves
- Dry-run mode for all changes
- Easy rollback for mistakes
- Safety > speed

### 4. Documentation-Driven
- Every change documented automatically
- Blog posts for each milestone
- Lessons learned captured
- Help others avoid our mistakes

### 5. Security by Default
- Credentials never in code
- Sanitization for blog posts
- Vault-based secret storage
- Least privilege access

## Why You Should Follow Along

### If You're Building a Home Lab
- Learn from our mistakes (we document them all!)
- Copy our working configurations
- Understand the "why" behind decisions
- See what works (and what doesn't)

### If You're Into AI/Automation
- Real-world AI orchestration example
- Practical multi-agent architecture
- API integration patterns
- Natural language to infrastructure

### If You're a Developer
- Python automation examples
- FastAPI REST services
- Async programming patterns
- Infrastructure monitoring integration

## What's Different About This Project?

### Honest About Challenges
We don't just show the final working state. We document:
- Problems encountered (5 major issues in Milestone 1!)
- Solutions that worked
- Solutions that didn't work
- Time invested
- Lessons learned

### Open Process
- Claude Desktop plans strategy
- Claude Code implements
- Everything documented in real-time
- Blog posts published immediately after completion

### Production Quality
This isn't a toy project:
- 68 real devices monitored
- 400+ sensors active
- Redundant monitoring platforms
- Actually manages my home network

## Current Status

**As of October 27, 2025:**
- ‚úÖ Dual monitoring infrastructure operational
- ‚úÖ 11 critical devices with 100% redundancy
- ‚úÖ 68 total devices monitored
- ‚úÖ Both APIs tested and working
- ‚úÖ Ready for Monitoring Bridge deployment
